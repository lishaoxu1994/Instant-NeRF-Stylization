# Instant-NeRF-Stylization






















## Comments

- Our codebase is based on the [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) implemented by [JNeRF](https://github.com/Jittor/JNeRF).
- We use dataset nerf_synthetic and nerf_llff_data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1), style images from [AdaIN-style](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style/tree/master/input/style).
